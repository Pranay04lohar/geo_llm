"""
Comprehensive Test for GEE Tool Workflow via Core LLM Agent

This script evaluates the end-to-end workflow for geospatial queries.
It tests the following pipeline:
1. User Query (geospatial in nature) is sent to the LLM Agent.
2. The agent's planner decides to use the `GEE_Tool`.
3. The `gee_tool_node` invokes the GEE pipeline (`roi_handler`, `hybrid_query_analyzer`, etc.).
4. The GEE pipeline executes a template and processes the results.
5. The final curated `analysis` and `roi` are returned.

This test does NOT mock the GEE tool components; it calls the actual implementation
in `core_llm_agent.py` to observe the real behavior, including fallbacks.
