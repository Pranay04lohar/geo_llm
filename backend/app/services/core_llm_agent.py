Core LLM Agent - Modular Geospatial Query Pipeline

ðŸ”„ REFACTORED: This module has been refactored from a monolithic 1900-line file 
into a clean, modular pipeline architecture.

New Structure:
- core_llm_agent/parsers/ â†’ Location parsing (NER + Nominatim)
- core_llm_agent/intent/ â†’ Hierarchical intent classification  
- core_llm_agent/dispatcher/ â†’ Service routing
- core_llm_agent/output/ â†’ Result formatting
- core_llm_agent/agent.py â†’ Main orchestrator

The new modular implementation provides:
âœ… Clean separation of concerns
âœ… Better testability and maintainability  
âœ… Hierarchical intent classification (GEE â†’ NDVI/LULC/LST)
âœ… Direct service integration (no HTTP overhead)
âœ… Comprehensive error handling and fallbacks
âœ… Backward compatibility with existing interfaces

Migration:
- Old: from app.services.core_llm_agent import build_graph
- New: from app.services.core_llm_agent import CoreLLMAgent

The original monolithic code is preserved in core_llm_agent_original.py for reference.
